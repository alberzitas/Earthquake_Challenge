# Earthquake Challenge

## Overview and Purpose

The objective for this project was to build insightful data visualizations for earthquakes around the world, complete with interactive features. For this project, we used JavaScript and the D3 library to traverse and retrieve GeoJSON earthquake data and tectonic plate data from the US Geological Survey in order to create an interactive map. Additionally, we used the leaflet library and Mapbox API to retrieve the GeoJSON data and host geographical maps.
